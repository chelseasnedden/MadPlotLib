Contained in the respository is a pharmaceuticals analysis I performed for data gathered by many mice and their response to cancer drug treaments.
----------------------------------------------------------
My Main Observations from this Data Set:
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Mouse weight is strongly correlated with tumor size.
----------------------------------------------------------
2. Ketapril and Naftisol seemed to perform worse than the placebo, in terms of average tumor volumes. 
----------------------------------------------------------
3. Capolumin had the best response to treatment.
